            " A chilly winter day reminds us of the very cold winter. It is biting cold. Life becomes difficult, particularly for the poor. The icy hand of nature dampens the spirit. The teeth clatter. The body shivers. We like to put on more woolen clothes. We cover the body from head to toe with clothes, overcoat, hand-gloves and heavy boots. Only a little of face, eyes and nose are visible. Rest of our body is tightly covered. The cold winds pierce through the body. They send a shiver to the spine. Everything is ice-cold and frozen.We like to take again and again hot tea, coffee and milk. Hot food is relished. One likes to stay in the quilt and warm room. Woolen clothes are much in demand. The cloth shops are flooded with warm stuff. Such shopkeepers do a roaring business. Parks and gardens wear a deserted look during the chilly winter day. People avoid going out of their houses. Only a very few regular walkers visit them. The fireplace is very favourite with one and all. People throng (crowd) coffee shops. In the countryside, there is little hustle and bustle.
